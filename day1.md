## 🔍 Why Cloud Computing?

| On-Premise                          | Cloud Computing                                |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Higher pay, less scalability       | Pay-as-you-go, scalable, no pre-scaling needed |
| Requires large server space        | No physical server space required              |
| Needs hardware/software team       | No hardware maintenance, minimal software upkeep |
| Poor data security                 | Strong data security                           |
| Limited data recovery              | Built-in disaster recovery                     |
| Rigid infrastructure               | Highly flexible                                |
| Manual updates                     | Automatic updates                              |
| Limited collaboration              | Global team collaboration                      |
| No remote access                   | Remote access via internet                     |

## 🧱 Cloud Service Models

- **IaaS**: Rent virtual machines, storage, and networks  
  - Example: AWS EC2  
  - Use case: Host websites, run databases, custom apps

- **PaaS**: Deploy code without managing infrastructure  
  - Example: Google App Engine  
  - Use case: Developer-friendly, fast deployment

- **SaaS**: Use ready-made software via browser  
  - Example: Gmail, Microsoft 365  
  - Use case: End-user productivity tools

## 🔄 Cloud Solution Lifecycle

1. Define the purpose
2. Define the Hardware - EC2, Lambda, Elastic Container Service
3. Define the Storage - S3, EFS, Glacier
4. Define the Network - VPC, Route 53, Direct Connect
5. Define Security - IAM, KMS, cognito
6. Define Management Process and Tools - CloudWatch, Autoscaling, CloudFormation
7. Testing the Process - CodeStar, CodeBuild, CodePipeline
8. Analytics - Athena, EMR, CloudSearch

## 📁 File Management Workflow

- Explore AWS Free Tier and set up an account
- Launch first EC2 instance and document steps
- Create and upload a file to S3 bucket
- Begin mapping service models to real-world use cases

**Flowchart**:  
Create AWS Account --> Create AWS S3 Bucket --> Upload Files --> Create AWS EC2 instance --> Sync AWS S3 & AWS EC2 instance
